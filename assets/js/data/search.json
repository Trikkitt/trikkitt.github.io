Hopefully this will guide you in selecting the most appropriate company for you to support.##Polybius Biotech#####Corporate Colours: orange, cyan###The name of this company reflects its heritage in the biotech industry, but since then it has woven its tentacles in to many industries across the planet. This has given rise to many subsidiary organisations under the “Poly” brand. PolyCoin being their crypto currency organisation. With so many industries it really spans the globe and has a finger in almost every pie.Some old Polybius research facilities have been discovered much to the frustration of Polybius Biotech’s management. The most recent was their highly controversial under water research lab found at Eastnor, UK. Confidential research projects in genetic engineering were leaked as a result.##Nefaridyne Group#####Corporate Colours: Magenta###This large conglomerate has been formed by the merger of multiple companies in the defence industry. Known for producing weapons that are generally regarded as pushing the boundaries of those permitted under international law. Many illegal weapons have appeared that are believed to be made by Nefaridyne Group but they have denied all knowledge of the products.##GFY Industries#####Corporate Colours: Yellow###Founded in 1984 it experienced years of very rapid growth. Well known in the energy industry as a supplier who really doesn’t care what they do to wildlife, coral reefs and the planet provided they can sell you more oil. This really embodies the ethos of the company and explains their name.Their aim is continue to squeeze the most out of oil and gas extraction, while expanding in to mining other materials. Their most ambitious project involves undersea mining of rare elements.##Nothing to see here Corporation#####Corporate Colours: Green###This organisation has remained mysteriously out of sight and very little is known about it. Yet it remains one of the most profitable companies on the planet. Despite the corporate colour being emerald they are largely believe to be anything close to a “green” company. They have a record of multiple billion dollar fines for pollution release events, and yet they still produce massive profits.They are well known to have links to many corrupt regimes, with substantial operations in regions many companies decline to do business with. It is believed there is substantial involvement in narcotics and other substances illegal in many countries, although no official link between illegal drugs and Nothing to see here Corporation has ever been established." }, { "title": "PolyCoin at MCH2022", "url": "/posts/PolyCoinInstructions/", "categories": "MCH2022", "tags": "", "date": "2022-07-19 16:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "PolyCoin is excited to be deploying their Crypto Miner units at MCH2022 following a successful deployment at EMF Camp 2022.##How to play##To play you simply need an RFID card. Most cards will work, although anything that generates a dynamic identified such as mobile phones or some bank cards will not work.You can collect a free RFID card from PolyCoin HQ at MCH if you don’t have one, there are a selection of 3D printed tokens available for purchase if you want something a bit more colourful.Present your RFID card or token to any PolyCoin crypto miner unit and it will report that it is checking your token.

Each visit recorded also results in bonus PolyCoins being generated. A re-visit is only counted when you have visited a different PolyCoin crypto miner in between your visits to any one PolyCoin crypto miner.Crypto miner units will ignore your token if you are the current owner of the unit or you were the last one to visit the unit.A one-off bonus is available if you played the game at EMF Camp 2022 and you have reused your token. In those circumstances you will be greated with a different welcome message when registering.##Rules##We ask that you follow these rules: Please do not interfer with other users playing the game.
