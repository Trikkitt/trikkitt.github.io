#Corporation Backgrounds#
The four corporations you can select to support each have a murky past.  Hopefully this will guide you in selecting the most appropriate company for you to support.

##Polybius Biotech##
###Corporate Colours: orange, cyan###
The name of this company reflects its heritage in the biotech industry, but since then it has woven its tentacles in to many industries across the planet. This has given rise to many subsidiary organisations under the "Poly" brand.  PolyCoin being their crypto currency organisation.  With so many industries it really spans the globe and has a finger in almost every pie.

Some old Polybius research facilities have been discovered much to the frustration of Polybius Biotech's management.  The most recent was their highly controversial under water research lab found at Eastnor, UK.  Confidential research projects in genetic engineering were leaked as a result.


##Nefaridyne Group##
###Corporate Colours: Magenta###
This large conglomerate has been formed by the merger of multiple companies in the defence industry.  Known for producing weapons that are generally regarded as pushing the boundaries of those permitted under international law.  Many illegal weapons have appeared that are believed to be made by Nefaridyne Group but they have denied all knowledge of the products. 


##GFY Industries##
###Corporate Colours: Yellow###
Founded in 1984 it experienced years of very rapid growth. Well known in the energy industry as a supplier who really doesn't care what they do to wildlife, coral reefs and the planet provided they can sell you more oil.  This really embodies the ethos of the company and explains their name.

Their aim is continue to squeeze the most out of oil and gas extraction, while expanding in to mining other materials.  Their most ambitious project involves undersea mining of rare elements.


##Nothing to see here Corporation##
###Corporate Colours: Green###
This organisation has remained mysteriously out of sight and very little is known about it.  Yet it remains one of the most profitable companies on the planet. Despite the corporate colour being emerald they are largely believe to be anything close to a "green" company.  They have a record of multiple billion dollar fines for pollution release events, and yet they still produce massive profits.

They are well known to have links to many corrupt regimes, with substantial operations in regions many companies decline to do business with.  It is believed there is substantial involvement in narcotics and other substances illegal in many countries, although no official link between illegal drugs and Nothing to see here Corporation has ever been established.
