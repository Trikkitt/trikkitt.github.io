Interested to know whats inside these units? Want to know how the game works?  Then come along to Null Sector on Sunday at 14:00 and head to the dance floor area.  Get the brief history of the game, see how the units can be opened, get to see the previous versions, ask any questions you may have about the game, maybe even get a clue to the CTF problem if you ask.

It isn't in the schedule yet, but hang tight and it should appear.  If it does say it is in the lounge, then please ignore that and head to Null Sector.

See you there!
