Polybius Biotech are pleased an announce the deployment of their PolyGen portable fusion generators across EMF Camp 2024.


## How to play
To play you simply need an RFID card. Most cards will work, although anything that generates a dynamic identified such as mobile phones or some bank cards will not work.  

You can collect a free RFID card from the PolyGen Home Base just outside Null Sector by the North West live-in vehicle section, look for a light blue gazebo by the DK nearest Null Sector.  There are a selection of 3D printed tokens available for purchase if you want something a bit more colourful.  These will be moved to the Null Sector when it opens and will hopefully be in the night market too.

PolyGen units are deployed all around EMF Camp.  Locate one of these units and present your RFID card or token to the centre of the unit. As a new player it will then ask you to select a global corporation to support.
There are four companies you can choose from:
- Nepheradine Group (Orange)
- GFY Corporation (Yellow)
- Malevolant Enterprises (Teal)
- ~~Nothing to see here Industries~~ Rebels (Emerald)

Nothing to see here Industries appears to be having technical issues, with a group calling themselves Rebels subverting the power for their own needs.

Simply tap you token a second time when the PolyGen unit is illuminated the colour of the company you wish to support.  Your token will then be locked to that corporation.  

Now go and seek other PolyGen units and present your token.  If it isn't your team colour you will capture it for your team and it will commence generating power for your chosen corporation.

If a PolyGen unit is already your company colour then you can still present your token, this will record you as visiting and boost the output of that unit for as long as it is held by your team.

## Scoring
PolyGen fusion generators generate 1kWh per second while it is held by you and your corporation.  Each visit recorded also results in additional output.  When boosting a PolyGen unit you'll be gaining 0.1kWh per second for you and your corporation.

PolyGen units will ignore your token if you are the current owner of the unit or you were the last one to visit the unit. A re-visit is only counted when you have visited at least one other PolyGen unit between your two visits to the first, and someone else has visited the first unit as well.

You will be told if you are already boosting, or if the unit is running hot.  For around 2.5 minutes after boosting output the PolyGen unit will be running hot and unable to accept further boosting.  Simply try again after a few minutes and you'll be able to boost output.

A one-off bonus is available if you played the game at EMF Camp 2022 or MCH 2022 and you have reused your token.  In those circumstances you will be greated with a different welcome message when registering.

Full scoring details as follows:
- Capture and hold: 1 per second held
- First Visit: 100 one-off
- Return Visit: 50 one-off
- Returning Player: 5,000 per event
- Output Boost: 0.1 per second held

## Rules
We ask that you follow these rules:
  - Please do not interfer with other users playing the game.  If they are already attempting to take control of the unit then please permit them to finish.
  - Do not block others from accessing a unit by hiding it, moving it, blocking access to it or being obstructive.
  - Do not attempt to open the units, they will make a lot of noise!  If you are interested in seeing how they look inside then please drop by PolyGen Home Base.  Hopefully there will be a talk in the Null Sector if you're interested in a bit more detail.
  - Do not clone RFID cards.  Each player should be unique.
  - Do not operate multiple cards, one player, one card.

## Timings
The game will start on Thursday 20th May at 20:00 and run until Sunday 2nd May at 20:00

## PolyCoin Home Base
At PolyCoin Home Base located in a light blue gazebo near a DK by the north west live-in vehicles section.  Feel free to drop by and say hi.

In addition there will be a scoreboard in the Cybar area of Null Sector where you can see a live map of PolyGen units.  Note that units only appear on the map once they have been discovered.  A unit that is uncaptured will not show on the map, so you'll need to go find them.
