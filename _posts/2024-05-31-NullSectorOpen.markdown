With Null Sector now open PolyGen have managed to deploy 6 PolyGen units across the area with highly boosted outputs, giving 4x power output to all units deployed there and at PolyGen HQ near by.  However these units can only provide this boosted output for a maximum of 2 hours, after which their output becomes unstable and reverts to neutral.

With the opening of the Null Sector units the CTF challenge is now achievable.  Good luck!
