What Hackers Yearn 2025 is over and so we must analyse the stats from this year's PolyGen game!

## General Stats

- Total players: 730
- Total players scoring over 1,000 points: 496
- Total players score: 8,732,428
- Total unit captures: 13,902
- Total unit visits: 14,292
- Total output boosts: 2,501
- Players who set a codename: 124
- Players too lazy to set a codename: 606
- Maximum Units Online: 25
- Units Failed: 0
- Player reusing tokens from previous events: 10
- Units vandalised: 2
- Units stolen: 1

Some players decided it was good to use a payment card or secure card to play:
- Total payment/secure cards used: 17
- Unidentified Type: 11
- Mastercard: 3
- Visa Card: 1
- Visa Debit Card: 2

The game records which audio clip it played to the player when they registered.  It doesn't save any card information or try to access the payment applications on the cards, it just queries the 2PAY.SYS file to see which payment applications exist on the card.  It doesn't try hard, and gives up quickly if it can't.  This is why most cards are simply identified as payment cards.  Players who used a payment card would have heard something like "Visa Debit card accepted, authorising donation to Polybius Biotech please wait... Just kidding.".

## Unit Battery Monitoring

Each unit reports its battery voltage regularly.  The following shows how each unit was doing.

Very pleased to report that they still had a fair bit of power left even at the end of the event.  The units with the most captures had the lowest battery voltage at the end of the event at 3.45 volts, but it wasn't fully charged to start with. The lowest fully charged unit ended at 3.51v and was the Info Desk.

Units are regarded as low battery and start sending alerts when they reach 3.35 volts.  When they reach 3.05 volts they are regarded as depleted and will power off.  There is a secondary protection built into the power regulator that will shutdown when the battery voltage drops to 2.5 volts.  Thankfully no recharging was required!
