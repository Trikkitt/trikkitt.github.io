39C3 is over and so we must analyse the stats from the PolyGen game!

## General Stats

- Total players: 1681
- Total players scoring over 1,000 points: 1,134
- Total players score: 11,392,010
- Total unit captures: 30,294
- Total unit visits: 33,164
- Total output boosts: 2,899
- Players who set a codename: 257
- Players too lazy to set a codename: 1,424
- Maximum Units Online: 36
- Units Failed: 0
- Units vandalised: 0
- Units stolen: 0

Some players decided it was good to use a payment card or secure card to play:
- Total payment/secure cards used: 59
- Unidentified Type: 43
- Mastercard: 2
- Masercard Debit: 3
- Visa Card: 1
- Visa Debit: 9
- Visa Credit: 1

The game records which audio clip it played to the player when they registered.  It doesn't save any card information or try to access the payment applications on the cards, it just queries the 2PAY.SYS file to see which payment applications exist on the card.  It doesn't try hard, and gives up quickly if it can't.  This is why most cards are simply identified as payment cards.  Players who used a payment card would have heard something like "Visa Debit card accepted, authorising donation to Polybius Biotech please wait... Just kidding.".

## Unit Battery Monitoring

Each unit reports its battery voltage regularly.  The full battery status info will be published later.

One unit ran out of battery - the PolyGen HQ.  Most likely this was due to all the players registering.  It was back online within a few minutes following a battery swap.  All other units lasted the whole event, many with plenty more capacity.  Aside from the PolyGen HQ unit the battery use followed roughly the number of captures.

Units are regarded as low battery and start sending alerts when they reach 3.35 volts.  When they reach 3.05 volts they are regarded as depleted and will power off.  There is a secondary protection built into the power regulator that will shutdown when the battery voltage drops to 2.5 volts.  Thankfully no recharging was required!
