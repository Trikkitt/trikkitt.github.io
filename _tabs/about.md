> PolyCoin is a game created with inspiration from Ingress.  It had a previous version called "Orbs Game" that appeared at EMF Camp 2018.  This is the updated one that is intended to fix some of the issues and be a bit more visually / audibly impressive.  

Please use the players web portal [[http://player.coin.polyb.io:1880/ui]].  Or visit the PolyCoin HQ by the party stage.

The game was created by Michael Turner [[http://trikkitt.com]] [[https://twitter.com/trikkitt]]
